# space_MAGE_

## Backstory

In the far future, AI-controlled mega-corporations rule the galaxy's
economy and have one objective: gather energy. With suns being leeched
of light and dark matter extraction disturbing the gravitational makeup
of the galaxy, the galaxy needs a hero to fight for humanity's survival.

In a desperate measure, propanemike01 awakens MAGE, a venture capitalist
from the old days, to fight the central AI cluster bringing ruin to the
galaxy.
